# imcscreenshots

Short script that uses puppeteer to screenshot pages from a google sheet. Different sites are stored under /screenshots/{sitename}/{level-2}.{level-3}.{pagename]}.jpg.


I used this for [this post](https://dev.to/sagar/how-to-capture-screenshots-with-puppeteer-3mb2) for the initial puppeteer script. The only thing I changed was made it full-page screenshots, and a map of json from a google sheets to match what I wanted.
